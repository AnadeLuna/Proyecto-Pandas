The objetive of this proyect is to demonstrate all i learned with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Regex. For clean and analise the database.

First step, Download the DataSet(attacks.csv) from Kaggle. Here we can find the global Shark Attack in the world for years.

Second step, Import to Jupyter Notebook to start cleaning some data. For example empty columns or rows.

Thirt step, Determine my hypothesis. So i want to analise the shark attacks in the last 10 years. Bearing in mind: month attacks, countries, sex of the people attacked and deaths.

Forth step, Start to clean well all this data, delete duplicate values, rename correct the data and the values, check if it´s correct and all the things that you can do for a perfect clean. 

Fifth step, Export in a csv file for to start the analise with graphics and have a visual result.
